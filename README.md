stack
=====
our stack project

Group: @JuliusClaudius @c15rl @ofreiberg

Functions of our program:

1. Peek (Depth): at a specific depth so that the user can see what is at a point in the stack of their choosing 
2. Pop at Random Depth:  
3. Replace: takes an int in the stack at a random point in the stack and replaces it with a different int
4. Peak at Random Depth: see what is in the stack at a random depth
5. Reverse: reverses the order of the ints in the stack so that if the initial order was 7 6 5 it would become 5 6 7
6. Push (Random/Set): pushes input into the stack at both a random depth and at a set depth
7. Pop All: pops the entire stack
